'''Create a Python class to represent a University. The university should have attributes
 like name, location, and a list of departments. Implement encapsulation to protect the
  internal data of the University class. Create a Department class that inherits from the
   University class. The Department class should have attributes like department name,
    head of the department, and a list of courses offered. Implement polymorphism
     by defining a common method for both the University and Department classes to
      display their details.
