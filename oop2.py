'''Build a Python class to represent a simple banking system. Create a class for a
 BankAccount, and another for Customer. The BankAccount class should have a constructor
  to initialize the account details (account number, balance, account type). The Customer class
   should have a constructor to set the customer's details (name, age, address) and create
    a BankAccount object for each customer. Implement a destructor for both classes to display a
     message when objects are destroyed
